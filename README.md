# Blog Project

This repository contains a small web application designed as a personal learning project. 
It serves as a sandbox for exploring various web development technologies, including **Node.js** (with **Express.js**), **TypeScript**, and **React**. 
The project aims to provide a hands-on approach to understanding these tools and how they can work together to create a modern web application.
